## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to use SQLAlchemy to connect to a SQLLite database. We were asked to analyze this data using numerous statistics (minimum, maximum, and average).
## Results
* The average tempurature for June is higher than the average temperature for December
* December yeilds a higher precipitation than June
* December has a lower minumum and maximum temperature
## Summary
The difference in statistics for the two months is not strong.  The average temperature and precipitation are pretty close.  The data suggests that opening a shop for the whole year is a good idea.
